## Development Plan for Spaceman Hangman Game (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

1.  Project Overview The Spaceman Hangman game will run entirely in the
    browser and involve guessing space-themed words. Players have a
    limited number of attempts to guess letters correctly before the
    spaceman loses all his parts. The game will include visuals for the
    spaceman, interactive UI elements, and basic animations.

2.  Development Phases Phase 1: Planning and Setup Tasks: Finalize Game
    Design:

Define the rules: Number of guesses before losing. Word categories
(space-themed words). Scoring (if any). Visual layout: Decide on the
spaceman drawing and word display. Set Up Project Folder Structure:

less Copy code /spaceman-hangman ├── index.html // Game's main HTML file
├── style.css // Styles for the game ├── script.js // Main JavaScript
file ├── assets/ // Folder for images (spaceman graphics) └── README.md
// Documentation Include a Placeholder Design:

A simple spaceman outline for the visuals. A placeholder UI with buttons
and the word display. Phase 2: Basic Game Implementation HTML: Create
the basic structure of the game: A heading for the game title ("Spaceman
Hangman"). A section to display the word as underscores (\_ \_ \_ \_). A
section to display the guessed letters and remaining attempts. Buttons
or an input field for user guesses. A div for the spaceman graphic. CSS:
Style the game elements: Use a space-themed background (e.g., stars,
planets). Style the word display with a clean, readable font. Create a
container for the spaceman graphic (placeholder for now). Add basic
hover and focus styles for interactive elements. Ensure the game is
responsive for different screen sizes. JavaScript: Implement the game
logic: Randomly select a word from an array of space-themed words.
Replace the word with underscores for display. Capture user input and
check if the letter is in the word. Track correct and incorrect guesses
in separate arrays. Update the remaining attempts and guessed letters on
the UI. End the game when the word is guessed or attempts run out. Phase
3: Visuals and Feedback Spaceman Graphics Create a simple spaceman
graphic:

Use a combination of CSS and an image sprite (or draw with HTML
```{=html}
<canvas>
```
). Break the spaceman into parts (e.g., head, body, arms, legs). Update
the graphic dynamically based on incorrect guesses. Integrate the
spaceman into the game:

Use JavaScript to show/hide parts as guesses progress. User Feedback Add
visual feedback:

Highlight correct and incorrect guesses. Display a message for wins and
losses. Shake the input field or play a simple animation for incorrect
guesses. Add audio (optional):

A short sound effect for correct/incorrect guesses. Victory or game-over
music. Polish Fine-tune the CSS: Ensure the layout is visually appealing
and aligned. Add transitions for smoother UI updates. Phase 4: Advanced
Features Difficulty Levels:

Allow users to select difficulty at the start: Easy: More guesses and
shorter words. Hard: Fewer guesses and longer words. Hint System:

Add a button to reveal a random letter at the cost of one remaining
attempt. Replay and Score Tracking:

Add a "Play Again" button. Display the number of wins/losses during the
session. Phase 5: Testing and Launch Testing Tasks: Test on multiple
browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Ensure the game is
mobile-friendly (responsive design). Debug issues: Input validation
(prevent repeated guesses, invalid characters). Game logic (win/lose
conditions). Launch Tasks: Deploy the game: Host on GitHub Pages,
Netlify, or another static site hosting platform. Test live deployment
for any issues. Share with friends or community forums for feedback. 3.
Tools and Resources Code Editor: VS Code or any preferred editor.
Graphics: CSS shapes, or simple spaceman sprite. Fonts: Use Google Fonts
for stylish text (e.g., "Orbitron" for a space theme). Sounds: Free
sound effects from sites like Freesound.
